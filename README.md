# OSS Penetration Test Tool

Currently, there are plenty of network security tools that run on the mobile platform, especially on the Google Android platform. But there are a lot fewer that support mobile Apple devices like iPhone and iPad, and open-source ones are nearly non-exist. OSS Penetration Tool for iOS is an open-source network security tool that runs primarily on Apple iOS.The whole project are mostly written in Python language. Thanks to the under-laying open-source framework named Kivy and KivyMD, it runs all on major OS like Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android. Currently, it only provides two basic features:

(1) Fierce DNS reconnaissance tool  (Python port)

(2) A simple TCP port scanner.

But since it includes a framework to integrate command-line python-based network security tools easily, more features will be added very soon.
